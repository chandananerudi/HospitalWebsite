# Hospital Website
I utilized the Django framework to develop a hospital website that incorporates HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as front-end technologies. JavaScript was implemented to ensure user-friendly and responsive design, while Python served as the backend technology. The default Django database, PostgreSQL, was utilized for data storage and management.
